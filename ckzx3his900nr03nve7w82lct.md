## What you need,Become a blockchain developer

Blockchain technology is a mysterious one. There are many protocols and terminologies that can be confusing. This can be overwhelming if you are just starting out. It can be difficult to learn how to become a blockchain developer. This article explains the roles and responsibilities for blockchan developers. It is intended for tech-lovers and developers who want to explore blockchain development.

Here are some things you should know before you start.

****Who are the blockchain developers?****

Blockchain is a protocol-intensive technology. Its consensus-driving protocol adds security, transparency and other benefits to a company. Blockchain developers work to optimize consensus protocols, create architectures for blockchain systems, as well as build decentralized web applications.

Further, the role of developers of blockchain is divided into --

1.  Core Blockchain Development
2.  Blockchain Software Development

****Core Blockchain Development****

The core of blockchain development involves optimizing consensus protocols for specific applications. Consensus - the way the network comes to a consensus â€“ is the core of any blockchain-based application. These developers will also be responsible for making high-level decisions.

The core blockchain developer's role is, in a nutshell:

1.  Constructing security protocols and consensus
2.  Supervising and designing network architecture

**Blockchain Software Developers**

These are software developers who use protocols and architecture created by core blockchain developers to create decentralized apps that use blockchain technology such as Ethereum. It is essential to understand the workings of different blockchain technologies and how software development works in order to excel at this job.

This role is similar to that of web developers. Web architects are used by developers to create web applications. Blockchain developers create decentralized apps (D apps), by using design, protocols, and algorithms developed by core blockchain developers.

The Blockchain Software Developers are responsible for-

1.  D-Apps front-end development
2.  Maintaining and building backend D-apps
3.  Smart contracts

****Skills to be a Blockchain Developer****

What do you need to learn to be a blockchain developer?

Blockchain development requires technical knowledge. You may be able to see that fundamentals in software development are essential for any good blockchain developer.

1.  **Blockchain architecture**  Cryptographic hash functions and distributed ledger technology should all be within reach. These terminologies are crucial for understanding the basics of blockchain. The Bitcoin Whitepaper is a great place to start and learn about these terminologies. You can also take short-term courses or get certifications.
    
2.  **Data structure**  - It is crucial to understand data structures in order to develop. It is even more crucial for blockchain. Blockchain employs several data structures with cryptography to create immutable and scalable records. You will also use merkle trees and petrecia trees as well as other data structures when working with blockchain. Core developers, software developers, and blockchain engineers will need to be familiar with data structures and algorithms.
    
3.  **Cryptography**  SHA256, KECCAK256 and  [asynchronous cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)  are used to create digital signatures that aid in identification. It is almost impossible to develop blockchain technology if you don't understand how cryptography algorithms work.
    
4.  **Web development**  Blockchain development relies on a variety of web-based services, APIs and tools. Blockchain development requires an understanding of the basics of APIs, user experience design, and request handling. Many blockchain developers begin as backend or front-end developers.
    
5.  **Smart contract**  - Blockchain is becoming increasingly integrated with smart contracts. Smart contracts make it easier to implement business logic. Future blockchain technologies will incorporate smart contract functionality.
    

You now know the basics of blockchain development. Let's get started.

UltraSafe Token – Perhaps this is for those who likes to play with meme tokens with reflection rewards but are afraid of getting hacked and losing all their investment? What is safer than just safe? UltraSafe I guess? Don’t know. But the project seems to suggest that they are a security focused token and looks like they have partnered with other projects to ensure that the token will not be abused or hacked. Which if you ask me, is a good thing right? We do see quite a lot of projects that got hacked and plenty of investors losing money. But the marketcap for this project is still rather small. Even if the token’s contract might be secure, with such a small marketcap, it is going to be difficult to stop price manipulators from wrecking investors. Admittedly though, this project only started in Q4 of 2021.

However do note that I am not encouraging my viewers to go purchase this token. I myself do not hold any of this UltraSafe token in my portfolio.
